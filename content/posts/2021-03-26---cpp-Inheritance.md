Inheritance is a way to base a class to a parent class. The inherited class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class. Another advantage of using classes is that you can inherit one class from a base class or sometimes known as a parent class. This is useful when you're planning to make a second class that has the same features as another class but want to add more attributes and methods while keeping it distinct.

## Types of Inheritance

There are five types of inheritance, namely:

- Single Inheritance - the parent has one child
- Multiple Inheritance - multiple parents, one child
- Hierarchical Inheritance - single parent, multiple children
- Multilevel Inheritance - the parent has children, grandchildren, and so on and so forth
- Hybrid Inheritance - a combination of multiple types of inheritance

## Syntax

To inherit a class from a base class simply use the syntax

```cpp
class SubClass : public BaseClass { ... };
```

Example:

```cpp
class Item {
  public:
    string name;
    double price;

  private:
    string id;
};

class Weapon : public Item {
  public:
    int damage;
    int durability;
};

class Consumable : private Item {
  public:
    string effect;
    int effect_multiplier;
}
```

The `Weapon` class is derived from the `Item` class. This results in the `Weapon` class having the following attributes:

*Notice how private attributes or methods do not get inherited*

```plaintext
Weapon
  public
    name
    price
    damage
    durability
  private
    *nothing*
```

The `Consumable` class is also derived from the `Item` class, but take note of the `private` access specifier on the class declaration. This means that the public and protected classes from the base class will become a private attribute or method of the sub class. The `Consumable` class will now have the following attributes:

*Notice how the `name` and `price` attributes from the base class, are inherited to the private parts of the `Consumable` class.*

```plaintext
Consumable
  public
    effect
    effect_multiplier
  private
    name
    price
```
