## Using with variables

If statements are also more useful if used together with [variables](/posts/cpp-variables) and [input/output](/posts/cpp-input-output). 

Let's say in our program that if the user inputted a number less than 5, it outputs `Too low`, while if the user inputs a number greater than 5, it outputs `Too high`, however if the user inputs exactly 5 the program outputs `Just right`.

Example 1:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int input;

    cout << "Input a number:" << endl;

    cin >> input;

    if (input == 5) {       // Checks if input is equal to 5
        cout << "Just right" << endl;
    } else if (input < 5) { // Checks if input is less than 5
        cout << "Too low" << endl;
    } else if (input > 5) { // Checks if input is more than 5
        cout << "Too high" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The `==` operator compares the values if they are the same.

Output 1a:

```
Input a number:
3
Too low
```

Output 1b:

```
Input a number:
8
Too high
```

## Even/Odd

An example of if statements in action is a program that will determine if the number the user inputted is even or odd. First let's lay some math.

- When a number is divided by 2 then has **no remainder** then the number is **even**
- When a number is divided by 2 then has **a remainder** then the number is **odd**

To determine the remainder we can simply use the modulo operator denoted with `%` (ex. `10 % 2`). The example is the same as dividing 10 by 2, but instead of returning the quotient, we'll get the remainder.

Let's modify the main function of our previous program.

Example:

```cpp
int main() {
    int input;

    cout << "Enter a number:" << endl;

    if (input % 2 == 0) {        // Checks if remainder is 0
        cout << "The number you entered is even" << endl;
    } else if (input % 2 != 0) { // Checks if remainder is not 0
        cout << "The number you entered is odd" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The `!=` operator checks if the values are **not** the same.
