Input and output in C++ are done with cin >> and cout << respectively. Before using them, be sure to include the iostream library header.

On the top of almost all programs written in c++, you would see the include statement `#include <iostream>`. The iostream library header is what enables us to use `cin` and `cout`, while `using namespace std;` makes it possible to omit `std::` before `cin` and `cout`. Without `using namespace std;` you need to use `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

## Output

Output with C++ is done with `cout` which is short for console output. Take note of the direction of the arrows `<<`.

Example 1:

    #include <iostream>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        cout << "Hello world!" << endl;

        return 0;
    }

Output 1:

    Hello world!

You can output any [data type](/cpp-variables), in this case "Hello world!" is a string, but it can even be a variable. The `endl` after another `<<` denotes a line ending. Take note that everytime you want to output another thing, you can chain or stream your outputs using the `<<` operator.

Example 2:

    int main() {
        cout << "Hello world!" << " another thing" << endl << "Now this should be on the next line";

        return 0;
    }

Output 2:
    Hello world! another thing
    Now this should be on the next line

## Input

Input on the other hand is done with `cin` which is short for console input. Take note of the direction of the arrows `>>`. You always definitely need to use [variables](/cpp-variables) together with `cin` as you need something to store the user input to.

Example:

    #include <iosteram>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        int input1;

        cout << "Please enter a number" << endl;
        cin >> input1;

        cout << "You have entered " << input1;

        return 0;
    }

Output:

    Please enter a number
    50
    You have entered 50

See how the program first asked the user to input a number? After asking the program, it awaits our input and it will not proceed until we entered our input, in this case I entered `50`. The number we inputted then gets **stored** to an int called `input1`. When we output `input1` it outputs `50` which was what was stored in that variable.
