Reading user input is an important part of a program. To collect user input from the terminal in Python, we use the input() method. To store user input to a variable, use \'variable = input()\'

## Syntax

```python
anyVar = input(inputQuestion)
```

Most of the time, user input needs to be stored in a variable to be read in the future.

The input() method can take in 1 string as a parameter. That string can count as the question the program asks before retrieving input.

## Application

As an example we will make an application that asks 2 numbers from the user and adds them.

```python
print("Input two numbers")
number1 = input("First number: ")
number2 = input("Second number: ")
answer = number1 + number2
print(answer)
```

Output:

```
Input two numbers
First number: 2
Second number: 3
5
```
